## 1.0.10
* switch to run as non-root user: netacuity

* use NetAcuity provided init script
* when using proxy, also add param US_INCLUDE_HTTP_HEADER, as stated in addendum to Users Guide
* removed java dependency
* download_url is now full url, tarball name is not assumed

## 1.0.9
* Added an NRPE plugin that directly queries netacutiy for data and alerts if the query fails.

## 1.0.8
* Fix the attribute that keeps NetAcuity from trying to upgrade the base system.  This prevents random service restarts

* Delete the init script on uninstall

* Address several food critic warnings

## 1.0.5
* Remove wt_base code.  There's no need for it

## 1.0.4
* Wrap the recipe in a deploy flag since this recipe will never leave webtrends
* Template the password file from the authorization data bag

## 1.0.3
* Fix passing the version attribute into the template

## 1.0.2:
* Use NetAcuity 5.0 by default.  There's no reason to pin to 4.6 as was required in Optimize

* Attempt to fix the gating

## 1.0.0:

* Initial transfer from Optimize
* Allow installing to any directory
* Move attributes out of databags an into environments
