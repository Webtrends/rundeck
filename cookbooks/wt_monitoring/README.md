Description
===========

The WT_Monitoring cookbook fills the void between the Nagios cookbook and reality.  There are many one-off monitoring implementations in the production environment that need to be present, but can only be accomplished with modifications to cookbooks.  This collection of cookbooks lets us maintain optimal monitoring, while not modifying stock cookbooks.
